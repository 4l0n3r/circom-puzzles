# Circom ZKP Puzzles Repository

Welcome! This repository is a personal collection of zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) puzzles and exercises that I am solving while learning Circom, inspired by the RareSkills ZKP blogs.

## What is Circom?
Circom is a specialized language for designing arithmetic circuits, primarily used for building zero-knowledge proofs. It allows you to create circuits that can be compiled and used in cryptographic protocols.

## Learning Journey
I am working through the RareSkills ZKP blogs, which contain a series of puzzles and exercises designed to teach the fundamentals of zero-knowledge proofs and circuit design using Circom. As I solve each puzzle, I add it to this repository for reference and future learning.
